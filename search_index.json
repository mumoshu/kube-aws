It's our users' responsibility to ensure existing AWS resources provided to kube-aws are properly configured.\nPlease note that you don't need to care about modifications if you've instructed kube-aws to create all the AWS resources for you i.e. you've omitted vpcId and routeTableId from cluster.yaml.\nWhat kube-aws does modify are:\n\nAdding a record set for Kubernetes API Endpoint to an existing hosted zone you've provided via the hostedZoneId configuration key in cluster.yaml\nAdding one or more subnet(s) to an existing VPC specified by the vpcId\nAssociating one or more subnet(s) to an existing route table specified by the routeTableId\n\nSee cluster.yaml for more details.\nAll the other configurations for existing AWS resources must be done properly by users before kube-aws is run.\nFor example, if you're deploying a cluster to an existing VPC:\n\nAn internet gateway or a NAT gateway needs to be added to VPC before cluster can be created\nOr all the nodes will fail to launch because they can't pull docker images or ACIs required to run essential processes like fleet, hyperkube, etcd, awscli, cfn-signal, cfn-init.\n\n\nExisting route tables must have a route to Internet in some form. For example, a default route to an internet gateway or to a NAT gateway via 0.0.0.0/0 would be needed or your cluster won't come up.

Before we launch our cluster, let's define a few parameters that the cluster requires.\nCluster parameters\nEC2 key pair\nThe keypair that will authenticate SSH access to your EC2 instances. The public half of this key pair will be configured on each CoreOS node.\nAfter creating a key pair, you will use the name you gave the keys to configure the cluster. Key pairs are only available to EC2 instances in the same region. More info in the EC2 Keypair docs.\nKMS key\nAmazon KMS keys are used to encrypt and decrypt cluster TLS assets. If you already have a KMS Key that you would like to use, you can skip creating a new key and provide the Arn string for your existing key.\nYou can create a KMS key in the AWS console, or with the aws command line tool:\n$ aws kms --region= create-key --description=\"kube-aws assets\"\n{\n    \"KeyMetadata\": {\n        \"CreationDate\": 1458235139.724,\n        \"KeyState\": \"Enabled\",\n        \"Arn\": \"arn:aws:kms:us-west-1:xxxxxxxxx:key/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n        \"AWSAccountId\": \"xxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\n        \"Enabled\": true,\n        \"KeyUsage\": \"ENCRYPT_DECRYPT\",\n        \"KeyId\": \"xxxxxxxxx\",\n        \"Description\": \"kube-aws assets\"\n    }\n}\n\nYou will use the KeyMetadata.Arn string to identify your KMS key in the init step.\nExternal DNS name\nSelect a DNS hostname where the cluster API will be accessible. Typically this hostname is available over the internet (\"external\"), so end users can connect from different networks. This hostname will be used to provision the TLS certificate for the API server, which encrypts traffic between your users and the API. Optionally, you can provide the certificates yourself, which is recommended for production clusters.\nWhen the cluster is created, the controller will expose the TLS-secured API on a public IP address. You will need to create an A record for the external DNS hostname you want to point to this IP address. You can find the API external IP address after the cluster is created by invoking kube-aws status.\nAlternatively, kube-aws can automatically create this A record in an existing Route 53 hosted zone. If you have a DNS zone hosted in Route 53, you can configure for it below.\nS3 bucket\nAmazon S3 buckets are used to transfer large stack templates generated by kube-aws to CloudFormation. If you already have a S3 bucket that you would like to use, you can skip creating a new bucket and provide the URI for your existing bucket.\nYou can create a S3 bucket in the AWS console, or with the aws command line tool.\nThe command varies among AWS regions.\nFor the us-east-1 region:\n$ aws s3api --region= create-bucket --bucket \n{\n    \"Location\": \"/\"\n}\n\nFor other regions:\n$ aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-bucket --region eu-west-1 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=eu-west-1\n\nInitialize an asset directory\nCreate a directory on your local machine to hold the generated assets:\n$ mkdir my-cluster\n$ cd my-cluster\n\nInitialize the cluster CloudFormation stack with the KMS Arn, key pair name, and DNS name from the previous step:\n$ kube-aws init \\\n--cluster-name=my-cluster-name \\\n--external-dns-name=my-cluster-endpoint \\\n--region=us-west-1 \\\n--availability-zone=us-west-1c \\\n--key-name=key-pair-name \\\n--kms-key-arn=\"arn:aws:kms:us-west-1:xxxxxxxxxx:key/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\"\n\nHere us-west-1c is used for parameter --availability-zone, but supported availability zone varies among AWS accounts.\nPlease check if us-west-1c is supported by aws ec2 --region us-west-1 describe-availability-zones, if not switch to other supported availability zone. (e.g., us-west-1a, or us-west-1b)\nThere will now be a cluster.yaml file in the asset directory. This is the main configuration file for your cluster.\nRender contents of the asset directory\nTLS certificates\n\nIn the simplest case, you can have kube-aws generate both your TLS identities and certificate authority for you.\n$ kube-aws render credentials --generate-ca\n\nThis is not recommended for production, but is fine for development or testing purposes.\n\nIt is recommended that you supply your own immediate certificate signing authority and let kube-aws take care of generating the cluster TLS credentials.\n$ kube-aws render credentials --ca-cert-path=/path/to/ca-cert.pem --ca-key-path=/path/to/ca-key.pem\n\nFor more information on operating your own CA, check out this awesome guide.\n\nIn certain cases, such as users with advanced pre-existing PKI infrastructure, the operator may wish to pre-generate all cluster TLS assets. In this case, you can run kube-aws render stack and copy in your TLS assets into the credentials/ folder before running kube-aws up.\n\nls -R credentials/\nadmin-key.pem       apiserver-key.pem   ca-key.pem          etcd-client-key.pem etcd-key.pem        worker-key.pem\nadmin.pem           apiserver.pem       ca.pem              etcd-client.pem     etcd.pem            worker.pem\n\n\n\nRender cluster assets\nThe next command generates the default set of cluster assets in your asset directory.\n  $ kube-aws render stack\n\nHere's what the directory structure looks like:\n$ tree\n.\nâ”œâ”€â”€ cluster.yaml\nâ”œâ”€â”€ credentials\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ admin-key.pem\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ admin.pem\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ apiserver-key.pem\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ apiserver.pem\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ca-key.pem\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ca.pem\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ worker-key.pem\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ worker.pem\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ etcd-key.pem\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ etcd.pem\nâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ etcd-client-key.pem\nâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ etcd-client.pem\nâ”œâ”€â”€ kubeconfig\nâ”œâ”€â”€ stack-template.json\nâ””â”€â”€ userdata\n    â”œâ”€â”€ cloud-config-controller\n    â””â”€â”€ cloud-config-worker\n\nThese assets (templates and credentials) are used to create, update and interact with your Kubernetes cluster.\nAt this point you should be ready to create your cluster. You can also now check the my-cluster asset directory into version control if you desire. The contents of this directory are your reproducible cluster assets. Please take care not to commit the my-cluster/credentials directory but rather to encrypt and/or put it to more secure storage, as it contains your TLS secrets and access tokens. If you're using git, the credentials directory will already be ignored for you.\nPRODUCTION NOTE: the TLS keys and certificates generated by kube-aws should not be used to deploy a production Kubernetes cluster.\nEach component certificate is only valid for 90 days, while the CA is valid for 365 days.\nIf deploying a production Kubernetes cluster, consider establishing PKI independently of this tool first. Read more below.\nDid everything render correctly?\nIf you are familiar with CoreOS and the AWS platform, you may want to include some additional customizations or optional features. Read on below to explore more.\nYes, ready to launch the cluster\nView optional features & customizations below\nCustomizations to your cluster\nYou can now customize your cluster by editing asset files. Any changes to these files will require a render and validate workflow, covered below.\nCustomize infrastructure\n\ncluster.yaml\nThis is the configuration file for your cluster. It contains the configuration parameters that are templated into your userdata and CloudFormation stack.\nSome common customizations are:\n\nchange the number of workers\nspecify tags applied to all created resources\ncreate cluster inside an existing VPC\nchange controller and worker volume sizes\n\n\n\nuserdata/\n\ncloud-config-worker\ncloud-config-controller\n\nThis directory contains the cloud-init cloud-config userdata files. The CoreOS operating system supports automated provisioning via cloud-config files, which describe the various files, scripts and systemd actions necessary to produce a working cluster machine. These files are templated with your cluster configuration parameters and embedded into the CloudFormation stack template.\nSome common customizations are:\n\nmounting ephemeral disks\nallow pods to mount RDB or iSCSI volumes\nallowing access to insecure container registries\nuse host DNS configuration instead of a public DNS server\nchanging your CoreOS auto-update settings\n\n\n\nstack-template.json\nThis file describes the AWS CloudFormation stack which encompasses all the AWS resources associated with your cluster. This JSON document is templated with configuration parameters, we well as the encoded userdata files.\nSome common customizations are:\n\ntweak AutoScaling rules and timing\ninstance IAM roles\ncustomize security groups beyond the initial configuration\n\n\n\ncredentials/\nThis directory contains both encryped and unencrypted TLS assets for your cluster, along with a pre-configured kubeconfig file which provides access to your cluster api via kubectl.\nYou can also specify additional access tokens in tokens.csv as shown in the official docs.\n\n\nKubernetes Container Runtime\nThe kube-aws tool now optionally supports using rkt as the kubernetes container runtime. To configure rkt as the container runtime you must run with a CoreOS version >= v1151.0.0 and configure the runtime flag.\nEdit the cluster.yaml file:\ncontainerRuntime: rkt\nreleaseChannel: stable\n\nNote that while using rkt as the runtime is now supported, it is still a new option as of the Kubernetes v1.4 release and has a few known issues.\nCalico network policy\nThe cluster can be optionally configured to use Calico to provide network policy. These policies limit and control how different pods, namespaces, etc can communicate with each other. These rules can be managed after the cluster is launched, but the feature needs to be turned on beforehand.\nEdit the cluster.yaml file:\nuseCalico: true\n\nRoute53 Host Record\nkube-aws can optionally create an ALIAS record for the controller's ELB in an existing Route53 hosted zone.\nJust run kube-aws init with the flag --hosted-zone-id to specify the id of the hosted zone in which the record is created.\nIf you've run kube-aws init without the flag, edit the cluster.yaml file to add loadBalancer.hostedZone.id under the first item of apiEndpoints:\napiEndpoints:\n- name: default\n  dNSName: kubernetes.staging.example.com\n  loadBalancer:\n    hostedZone:\n      id: A12B3CDE4FG5HI\n\n# DEPRECATED: use hostedZoneId instead\n#hostedZone: staging.example.com\n\n# DEPRECATED: use loadBalancer.hostedZone.id instead\n#hostedZoneId: A12B3CDE4FG5HI\n\n# DEPRECATED: use loadBalancer.createRecordSet instead\n# This is even implied to be true when loadBalancer.hostedZone.id is specified\n#createRecordSet: true\n\nIf createRecordSet is not set to true, the deployer will be responsible for making externalDNSName routable to the the ELB managing the controller nodes after the cluster is created.\nMulti-AZ Clusters\nKube-aws supports \"spreading\" a cluster across any number of Availability Zones in a given region.\nA word of caution about EBS and Persistent Volumes: Any pods deployed to a Multi-AZ cluster must mount EBS volumes via Persistent Volume Claims. Specifying the ID of the EBS volume directly in the pod spec will not work consistently if nodes are spread across multiple zones.\nRead more about Kubernetes Multi-AZ cluster support here.\nA common pitfall when deploying multi-AZ clusters in combination with cluster-autoscaler\ncluster-autoscaler is a tool that automatically adjusts the number of Kubernetes worker nodes when:\n\n\nthere is a pod that doesnâ€™t have enough space to run in the cluster\nsome nodes in the cluster are so underutilized, for an extended period of time, that they can be deleted and their pods will be easily placed on some other, existing nodes.\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler\n\n\nA common pitfall in deploying cluster-autoscaler to a multi-AZ cluster is that you have to instruct an Auto Scaling Group not to spread over multiple availability zones or cluster-autoscaler results in instability while scaling out the nodes i.e. it takes unnecessary much time to finally bring up a node in the insufficient zone.\n\nThe autoscaling group should span 1 availability zone for the cluster autoscaler to work. If you want to distribute workloads evenly across zones, set up multiple ASGs, with a cluster autoscaler for each ASG. At the time of writing this, cluster autoscaler is unaware of availability zones and although autoscaling groups can contain instances in multiple availability zones when configured so, the cluster autoscaler can't reliably add nodes to desired zones. That's because AWS AutoScaling determines which zone to add nodes which is out of the control of the cluster autoscaler. For more information, see https://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/pull/1552#discussion_r75533090.\nhttps://github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler/cloudprovider/aws#deployment-specification\n\nPlease read the following guides carefully and select the appropriate deployment according to your requirement regarding auto-scaling.\nFor production cluster not requiring cluster-autoscaler\nIf you don't need auto-scaling at all, or you need only the AWS-native auto-scaling i.e. the a combination of auto scaling groups, scaling policies, CloudWatch alarms,\ntheoretically, you can safely go this way.\nEdit the cluster.yaml file to define multiple subnets, each with a different availability zone hence multi-AZ:\n subnets:\n   - availabilityZone: us-west-1a\n     instanceCIDR: \"10.0.0.0/24\"\n   - availabilityZone: us-west-1b\n     instanceCIDR: \"10.0.1.0/24\"\n\nThis implies that you rely on AWS AutoScaling for selecting which subnet hence which availability zone to add a node when an auto-scaling group's DesiredCapacity is increased.\nPlease read the AWS documentation for more details about AWS Auto Scaling.\nFor production cluster requiring cluster-autoscaler\nYou must utilize an experimental feature called Node Pool to achieve this deployment.\nPlease read the documentation for experimental features for more instructions.\nCertificates and Keys\nkube-aws render begins by initializing the TLS infrastructure needed to securely operate Kubernetes. If you have your own key/certificate management system, you can overwrite the generated TLS assets after kube-aws render. More information on Kubernetes certificate generation.\nWhen kube-aws up creates the cluster stack, it will use whatever TLS assets it finds in the credentials folder at the time.\nThis includes the certificate authority, signed server certificates for the Kubernetes API server and workers, and a signed client certificate for administrative use.\n\nAPIServerCert, APIServerKey\nThe API server certificate will be valid for the value of externalDNSName, as well as a the DNS names used to route Kubernetes API requests inside the cluster.\nkube-aws does not manage a DNS zone for the cluster.\nThis means that the deployer is responsible for ensuring the routability of the external DNS name to the public IP of the master node instance.\nThe certificate and key granted to the kube-apiserver.\nThis certificate will be presented to external clients of the Kubernetes cluster, so it should be valid for external DNS names, if necessary.\nAdditionally, the certificate must have the following Subject Alternative Names (SANs).\nThese IPs and DNS names are used within the cluster to route from applications to the Kubernetes API:\n\n10.0.0.50\n10.3.0.1\nkubernetes\nkubernetes.default\nkubernetes.default.svc\nkubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local\n\n\n\n\nWorkerCert, WorkerKey\nThe certificate and key granted to the kubelets on worker instances.\nThe certificate is shared across all workers, so it must be valid for all worker hostnames.\nThis is achievable with the Subject Alternative Name (SAN) *.*.compute.internal, or *.ec2.internal if using the us-east-1 AWS region.\n\nCACert\nThe certificate authority's TLS certificate is used to sign other certificates in the cluster.\nThese assets are stored unencrypted in your credentials folder, but are encyrpted using Amazon KMS before being embedded in the CloudFormation template.\nAll keys and certs must be PEM-formatted and base64-encoded.\n\n\nRender and validate cluster assets\nAfter you have completed your customizations, re-render your assets with the new settings:\n$ kube-aws render credentials\n$ kube-aws render stack\n\nThe validate command check the validity of your changes to the cloud-config userdata files and the CloudFormation stack description.\nThis is an important step to make sure your stack will launch successfully:\n$ kube-aws validate --s3-uri s3:///\n\nIf your files are valid, you are ready to launch your cluster.\n"},"getting-started/step-3-launch.html":{"url":"getting-started/step-3-launch.html","title":"Step 3: Launch","keywords":"","body":"Launch your Kubernetes cluster on AWS\nThis is the third step of running Kubernetes on AWS.

When the cluster is first being launched, it must download all container images for the cluster components (Kubernetes, dns, heapster, etc). Depending on the speed of your connection, it can take a few minutes before the Kubernetes api-server is available.\nConfigure DNS\nIf you configured Route 53 settings in your configuration above via createRecordSet, a host record has already been created for you.\nOtherwise, navigate to the DNS registrar hosting the zone for the provided external DNS name.

This is due to how CloudFormation works for updating a Spot Fleet\nIt is recommended to temporarily bring up an another, spare node pool to maintain the whole cluster capacity at a certain level while replacing the spot fleet.\n\n\n\nPre-requisites\nThis feature assumes you already have the IAM role with ARN like \"arn:aws:iam::youraccountid:role/aws-ec2-spot-fleet-role\" in your own AWS account.\nIt implies that you've arrived \"Spot Requests\" in EC2 Dashboard in the AWS console at least once.\nSee the AWS documentation describing pre-requisites for Spot Fleet for details.\nSteps\nTo add a node pool powered by Spot Fleet, edit node pool's cluster.yaml:\nworker:\n  nodePools:\n  - name: pool1\n    spotFleet:\n      targetCapacity: 3\n\nTo customize your launch specifications to diversify your pool among instance types other than the defaults, edit cluster.yaml:\nworker:\n  nodePools:\n  - name: pool1\n    spotFleet:\n      targetCapacity: 5\n      launchSpecifications:\n      - weightedCapacity: 1\n        instanceType: t2.medium\n      - weightedCapacity: 2\n        instanceType: m3.large\n      - weightedCapacity: 2\n        instanceType: m4.large\n\nThis configuration would normally result in Spot Fleet to bring up 3 instances to meet your target capacity:\n\n1x t2.medium = 1 capacity\n1x m3.large = 2 capacity\n1x m4.large = 2 capacity\n\nThis is achieved by the diversified strategy of Spot Fleet.\nPlease read the AWS documentation describing Spot Fleet Allocation Strategy for more details.\nPlease also see the detailed comments in cluster.yaml and the GitHub issue summarizing the initial implementation of this feature for further information.\nYou can optionally configure various Kubernetes add-ons according to your requirements.\nWhen you are done with your cluster, destroy your cluster\n"},"getting-started/step-6-configure-add-ons.html":{"url":"getting-started/step-6-configure-add-ons.html","title":"Step 6: Configure Add-ons","keywords":"","body":"Configuring Kubernetes Add-ons\nkube-aws has built-in supports for several Kubernetes add-ons known to require additional configurations beforehand.\ncluster-autoscaler\ncluster-autoscaler is an add-on which automatically\nscales in/out your k8s cluster by removing/adding worker nodes according to resource utilization per node.\nTo enable cluster-autoscaler, add the below settings to your cluster.yaml:\naddons:\n  clusterAutoscaler:\n    enabled: true\nworker:\n  nodePools:\n  - name: scaled\n    autoScalingGroup:\n      minSize: 1\n      maxSize: 10\n    autoscaling:\n      clusterAutoscaler:\n        enabled: true\n  - name: notScaled\n    autoScalingGroup:\n      minSize: 2\n      maxSize: 4\n\nThe above example configuration would:\n\nBy addons.clusterAutoscaler.enabled:\nProvide controller nodes appropriate IAM permissions to call necessary AWS APIs from CA\nCreate a k8s deployment to run CA on one of controller nodes, so that CA can utilize the IAM permissions\n\n\nBy worker.nodePools[0].autoscaling.clusterAutoscaler.enabled:\nIf there are unschedulable, pending pod(s) that is requesting more capacity, CA will add more nodes to the scaled node pool, up until the max size 10\nIf there are no unschdulable, pending pod(s) that is waiting for more capacity and one or more nodes are in low utlization, CA will remove node(s), down until the min size 1\n\n\nThe second node pool notScaled is scaled manually by YOU, because you had not the autoscaling on it(=missing autoscaling.clusterAutoscaler.enabled)\n\nkube2iam\nkube2iam is an add-on which provides IAM credentials for target IAM roles to pods running inside a Kubernetes cluster based on annotations.\nTo allow kube2iam deployed to worker and controller nodes to assume target roles, you need the following configurations.\n\nIAM roles associated to worker and controller nodes requires an IAM policy:\n{\n \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\",\n \"Resource\": \"*\",\n \"Effect\": \"Allow\"\n}\n\nTo add the policy to controller nodes, set experimental.kube2IamSupport.enabled to true in your cluster.yaml.\nFor worker nodes, it is worker.nodePools[].kube2IamSupport.enabled.\n\nTarget IAM roles needs to change trust relationships to allow kube-aws worker/controller IAM role to assume the target roles.\nAs CloudFormation generates unpredictable role names containing random IDs by default, it is recommended to make them predictable at first so that you can easily automate configuring trust relationships afterwards.\nTo make worker/controller role names predictable, set controller.managedIamRoleName for controller and worker.nodePools[].managedIamRoleName for worker nodes.\nmanagedIamRoleNames becomes suffixes of the resulting worker/controller role names. \nPlease beware that configuration of target roles' trust relationships are out-of-scope of kube-aws.\nPlease see the part of kube2iam doc for more information.
