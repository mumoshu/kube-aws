# Announcements

Older releases of kube-aws had been signed by the CoreOS key and were verifiable with the [CoreOS Application Signing Public Key](https://coreos.com/security/app-signing-key/). This was when kube-aws was maintained primarily by CoreOS. However, the signing process has been postponed since v0.9.3 since the comm.
